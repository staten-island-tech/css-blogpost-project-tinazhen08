              In 1970, paranormal investigators and demonologists Lorraine (Vera
              Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) Warren are summoned to the home
              of Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston) Perron. The
              Perrons and their five daughters have recently moved into a
              secluded farmhouse, where a supernatural presence has made itself
              known. Though the manifestations are relatively benign at first,
              events soon escalate in horrifying fashion, especially after the
              Warrens discover the house's macabre history.

              Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes winter caretaker at the
              isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado, hoping to cure his writer's

              and his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who is plagued by psychic
              premonitions. As Jack's writing goes nowhere and Danny's visions
              become more disturbing, Jack discovers the hotel's dark secrets
              and begins to unravel into a homicidal maniac hell-bent on
              terrorizing his family.
